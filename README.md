# Credit_Risk_Analysis

##Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

Under this analysis, the techniques for Supervised Machine Learning models were applied 
to a data collected from loans made to help the finace industry check the credit card risk.

For this reason, within the techniques applied we did the Logistic Regression playing at the same time with different sampling techniques from Oversampling, SMOTE and Undersampling to compare the results gotten from the analysis. At the end, it was made as well a sampling combination with the over and under at the same time. For all of them, we calculated the balanced accuracy score, the confusion matrix, and the imbalanced classification report. All of this analysis was made in ML environment on Jupyter Notebook with file named "Credit Risk Resampling".

On  the other hand, we applied Random Forest and ADaBoost classifier to the Credit Risk Ensemble file getting another results that we will comapre between them with the ones obtained from the first analysis to make some conclusions.


According to the summary table ![Credit Risk Analysis.png](https://github.com/machinavic/Credit_Risk_Analysis.git) out of six models run into the same dataset, the AdaBoost was the most precise showing a value about 7% with a sensitivity of 91%. The accuracy of this model is 94% which is the greatest compared with the remaining ones.
